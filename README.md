# Weed Image Classifier using Self-Supervised Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a self-supervised learning (SSL) model for weed image classification. The model utilizes a Swin Transformer backbone along with Multi-Masked Image Modeling (MMIM) to learn robust representations without relying on labeled data during training.

This marks my **first Machine Learning model** being published on GitHub, and I am excited to share it with the community.

##  Project Description

Efficient weed classification is crucial for precision agriculture. This model is designed to classify images of various weed species using a self-supervised learning approach. It leverages:
- **Swin Transformer**: A hierarchical vision transformer that enables strong performance with lower computational cost.
- **Multi-Masked Image Modeling (MMIM)**: An SSL strategy that masks multiple image patches to improve feature learning.
