# Weed Image Classifier using Self-Supervised Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a self-supervised learning (SSL) model for weed image classification. The model utilizes a Swin Transformer backbone along with Multi-Masked Image Modeling (MMIM) to learn robust representations without relying on labeled data during training.

This marks my **first Machine Learning model** being published on GitHub, and I am excited to share it with the community.

##  Project Description

Efficient weed classification is crucial for precision agriculture. This model is designed to classify images of various weed species using a self-supervised learning approach. It leverages:
- **Swin Transformer**: A hierarchical vision transformer that enables strong performance with lower computational cost.
- **Multi-Masked Image Modeling (MMIM)**: An SSL strategy that masks multiple image patches to improve feature learning.

##  Key Features

-  Transformer-based feature extraction with **Swin Transformer**
-  Self-supervised learning via **MMIM**
-  Trained on a **custom weed image dataset**
-  Implemented in **PyTorch**
-  Live model available on Hugging Face Spaces

##  Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swati-prabhu/Weed-Classifier.git
cd Weed-Classifier
---
### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn matplotlib tqdm
---
### 3. Train the Model

Run the training script. You may need to adjust dataset paths inside the script.

```bash
python ssl014_vs_code_ready.py

---

### 4. Evaluate the Model

To test the trained model on new images, run the following script:

```bash
python weed_test.py

---

## Checkpoints

Model checkpoints generated during training are stored in the `MMIM_checkpoints/` directory.

The best-performing model is saved as:


You can load this checkpoint in `weed_test.py` for evaluation or inference.  
Make sure the path to this checkpoint is correctly set in your testing script.

---

## Deployment

This model has been deployed and is available for live testing via Hugging Face Spaces.

You can try out the model here:

 [Hugging Face Space - Weed Classifier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/NagashreePai/Weed_Classifier)

The interface allows you to upload a weed image and get a predicted class based on the trained model.
